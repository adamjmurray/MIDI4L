10/4/14 Initial.

You’ll need Max6.14 SDK:

http://cycling74.com/download/MaxSDK-6.1.4.zip

and maxcpp:

https://github.com/grrrwaaa/maxcpp/archive/master.zip

Follow the instructions for setting up maxcpp by placing its directory inside the maxsdk on the same level as Cycling74.

The “miditest” folder from this repository should be placed in the examples folder of the maxcpp directory.  You should be able to build from there.
